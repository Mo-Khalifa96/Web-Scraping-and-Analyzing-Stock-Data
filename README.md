# Web Scraping and Analyzing Stock Data

## About The Project
**This project involves web scraping and analyzing stocks data of Tesla and GameStop. It was completed in complying with a project-based course, 'Python Project
for Data Science', offered online by IBM. It employs a battery of popular Python libraries for data scraping and data analysis, including: 'yfinance' to extract 
stock data from Yahoo Finance, a quintessential platform for accessing financial news and reports; the 'beautiful soup' library for parsing HTML documents; and 
'pandas' and 'plotly' libraries for data analysis and visualization. Employing these libraries, I'll web scrape stock as well as (quarterly) revenue data for each 
of Tesla and GameStop, and then visualize their changes over time on a simple interactive dashboard.**

<br> 

**Overall, this project cover a range of data science tasks, including:** <br> 
&emsp; 1) Web scraping stock and revenue data <br>
&emsp; 2) Cleaning up and updating data <br>
&emsp; 3) Data parsing <br>
&emsp; 4) Creating an interactive dashboard for visualizing data <br>

<br>

I have attached two versions of the project, the first comprising the raw Python code in a Python script, meanwhile the second is a Jupyter Notebook version with 
the code from the original script but modified and broken down into separate sections and cells to suit Jupyter's user-friendly environment better.

## About The Data
**The data being analyzed for this project consist of the stock data and revenue amounts (particularly, quarterly revenue) for each of the companies Tesla and GameStop. 
The stock data for both companies are scraped from Yahoo Finance, which provides financial records of Tesla's stock dated since 2010 and GameStop's stock dated since 2002 
and up to the present day. As for the revenue data, Tesla's quarterly revenue are scraped from www.macrotrends.net, a platforms that also publishes financial records and 
reports. However, the quarterly revenue data of GameStop are scraped from a special link provided by IBM for the original project course. I've used here IBM's link for this 
task especially as it provides the quarterly revenue data for GameStop dated since 2005 whereas websites like 'macrotrends' publishes financial records that date no earlier 
than 2009.**

## Aim 
**The aim of this project is to demonstrate the repertoire of data science skills I have acquired thus far, as this project traverses through and covers different data science tasks, 
from dealing with data repositories to building dashboards for data visualization. Thus, completing this project serves to demonstrate my understanding  of the common applied data 
science techniques and tools and to solidify this knowledge and the skills I've acquired via hands-on experience.**

## Quick Access
**As per usual, you can access the project quickly from either of the links below. Both will direct you to the Jupyter notebook version with all the input code and resulting output 
organized and broken down into separate cells, rendered and ready for viewing. Each cell includes a block of code and its corresponding output, which makes the overall program easier
to read and interact with. Note however, the first link allows you to view the input code and output only, but without interacting with it. The second link, on the other hand, allows 
you to both view the input and output and also renders the code executable so that you can reproduce the results yourself if you wish to. If you wish to try the code yourself via the
second link, make sure to run the first two cells first before executing any of the code below so that the Python packages necessary for the task are installed, imported, and ready 
for use. To run any given cell, simply select the cell and click on the 'Run' icon on the notebook toolbar.**
